# Multi-Agent-Robotics (MAR)
In this repository, We are using 
1. [Linux (ubuntu-18.04)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC89AryJEE8&t=329s)
2. [ROS (Robot Operating System)](http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/Ubuntu)
3. [Gazebo (ROS Simulating Software)](http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=install_ubuntu)
4. Python-IDE (like [Anaconda]()) and Python(Ver-2 and Ver-3 both) in Command Prompt.
5. You need to create your own catkin workspace
for that follow this link http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials/create_a_workspace
after creating catkin workspace you need to create a package inside that workspace
http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/CreatingPackage
remember for creating a package you must follow this command
$ catkin_create_pkg m2wr_description std_msgs urdf rospy roscpp
after that, you need to copy the contents from my URDF folder []  and paste those inside your urdf folder.
